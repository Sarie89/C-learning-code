/*
DATA TYPES:
    - boolean:Stores true or false values
    - char: Stores a single character/letter/number, or ASCII values
    - int: Stores whole numbers, without decimals
    - double: Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. 
    - string: Stores a sequence of characters

  Numbers:
    - Use int when you need to store a whole number without decimals, like 35 or 1000
    - Double when you need a floating point number (with decimals), like 9.99 or 3.14515.
    - A floating point number can also be a scientific number with an "e" to indicate the power of 10. EX: f1 = 35e3

  Boolean:
    - A boolean data type is declared with the bool keyword and can only take the values true or false.
    - When the value is returned, true = 1 and false = 0.
    - You can use a comparison operator, such as the greater than (>) operator, to find out if an expression (or variable) is true or false
    - cout << (10 > 9); // returns 1 (true), because 10 is higher than 9
  
  Text:
    - The string type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). 
    - This is not a built-in type, but it behaves like one in its most basic usage. String values must be surrounded by double quotes
    - The char data type is used to store a single character. The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c'

OPERATORS:
- Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
  
  Arithmetic: 
    +	Addition. Adds together two values.	x + y	
    -	Subtraction. Subtracts one value from another.	x - y	
    *	Multiplication.	Multiplies two values.	x * y	
    /	Division. Divides one value by another.	x / y	
    %	Modulus. Returns the division remainder. x % y	
    ++	Increment.	Increases the value of a variable by 1.	++x	
    --	Decrement.	Decreases the value of a variable by 1.	--x

  Comparison:
    ==	Equal to	x == y	
    !=	Not equal	x != y	
    >	Greater than	x > y	
    <	Less than	x < y	
    >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
    <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

  Logical:
    && 	Logical and	Returns true if both statements are true	x < 5 &&  x < 10	
    || 	Logical or	Returns true if one of the statements is true	x < 5 || x < 4	
    !	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	!(x < 5 && x < 10)
