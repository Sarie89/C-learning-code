LOOPS:
  - A loop is a programming tool that repeats some code or a set of instructions until a specified condition is reached.
  - You’ll hear the generic term “iterate” when referring to loops; iterate simply means “to repeat”

WHILE LOOPS:
  - The While loop will continue to execute the code inside of it, over and over again, as long as the condition is true.
  EX:
   1.  while (condition) {

    statements
}
  2. while (guess != 8) {
  
      std::cout << "Wrong guess, try again: ";
      std::cin >> guess;
    
    }
